Here is a collection of interesting time complexity that I have encountered in my life.

* $O(\frac{1}{4n\sqrt{3}}\exp(\pi (2/3)^{1/2} \sqrt{n}))$
  * The growth rate of a partition number.
* $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n/\log n$
  * $O(n\log\log n)$
  * Mergesort integers with packing $\log n\log\log n$ integers in each word.
