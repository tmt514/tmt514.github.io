## 1 Byzantine Agreement

There are $N$ processores.
Each processors $p$ has a private input bit $v_p\in\{0, 1\}$.
Throughout the protocol, every process can asynchronously pass messages to any other processors through a authenticated channel. 
That is, it is assumed to be able to correctly identify the sender and the receiver by looking at the message itself.
Eventually every processor _decides_ an output bit and then halts.
The protocol is required to have the following properties:

* **Agreement**: all _good_ processors output the same bit.
* **Validity**: the output bit must occur as some _good_ processors's input bit.
* **Termination**: all _good_ processors halts after some a priori known round number $r$.

## 3 Bracha's Reliable Broadcast

> Gabriel Bracha. [_Asynchronous Byzantine Agreement Protocols_](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82523202.pdf), 1987.

The first abstraction of this model is the _reliable broadcast_. They have the following properties:


1. Send $(initial, m)$ to all processors.
2. Upon receiving $(initial, m)$, send $(echo, m)$ to all processors.
