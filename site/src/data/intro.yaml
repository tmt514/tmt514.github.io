- intro: |
    I am currently a Postdoc in [Boston College](https://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/schools/mcas/departments/computer-science.html) advised by [Hsin-Hao Su](https://sites.google.com/site/distributedhsinhao/).
    I obtained my Ph.D. at [University of Michigan](https://cse.umich.edu)
    advised by [Seth Pettie](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~pettie/).
    I am interested in any cool analysis techniques of an algorithm, as well as any cool stuff related to graphs.
    I also love [competitive programming](https://cphof.org/profile/topcoder:tmt514).

    **Research Interest**:
    Dynamic Graph Data Structures and Algorithms.
    Asynchronous Distributed Algorithms.
    Distributed Graph Algorithms.
    Algorithms in Word RAM Model.
    Lower bound graphs for sparse distance preservers.
