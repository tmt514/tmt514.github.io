- intro: |
    I am currently an assitant professor in [CSIE, National Taiwan University](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/).
    Previously, I was a Postdoc in [Boston College](https://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/schools/mcas/departments/computer-science.html) advised by [Hsin-Hao Su](https://sites.google.com/site/distributedhsinhao/).
    I had the honor of being advised by [Seth Pettie](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~pettie/) while pursuing my Ph.D. at the [University of Michigan](https://cse.umich.edu).
    I am interested in any cool analysis techniques of an algorithm, as well as any cool stuff related to graphs.
    I also love [competitive programming](https://cphof.org/profile/topcoder:tmt514).

    **Research Interest [[CV]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cl1hOs15vXQZPaM1pCCZwpUdfk9158Jm/view)**:
    Dynamic Graph Data Structures and Algorithms.
    Asynchronous Distributed Algorithms.
    Distributed Graph Algorithms.
    Algorithms in Word RAM Model.
    Lower bound graphs for sparse distance preservers.
