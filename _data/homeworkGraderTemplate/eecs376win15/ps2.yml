      reason: picking a string that is not pumpable

      reason: you should consider all the possible xyz
    - score: 3
      reason: you derive the pumped string in the wrong way

      reason: you should decide what the pumping length p is.
    - score: 3
      reason: you should handle all possible s of length >= p
    - score: 3
      reason: you picked the wrong y in case 1.
    - score: 3
      reason: if you pick y as ones, then the constraint |xy|<=p will not generally be satisfied.
    - score: 3
      reason: your pumping criteria would not hold when a=2.
    - score: 6
      reason: you should decide what x,y,z is for any such s of length >= p, and prove it.

      reason: the L' you picked make the intersection be a regular language
    - score: 4
      reason: you are not proving correctly that their intersection is non-regular
    - score: 2
      reason: Your L - L1 is a regular language, and it is not equal to L2.

    - score: 3
      reason: You did not prove every string in L can be generated by your CFG.

      reason: s was chosen incorrectly, your number of 0s was greater than 1s.
    - score: 2
      reason: case 2 not correctly proved. vxy contains zero does not mean vy has to contain zero.
    - score: 6
      reason: you have to handle all possible ways to split s.
    - score: 2
      reason: you have to prove explicitly in the case when vxy contains zeroes and ones

  rubics:
    - score: 6
      reason: the intersection of L and G is emptyset, which is context-free by giving an empty grammar.
    - score: 4
      reason: you have to consider all possible ways to split s.
